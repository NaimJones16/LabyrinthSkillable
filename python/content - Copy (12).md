###Module 02 - Connecting Agents to Memory


Introduction

In this Module you'll connect your agent to Azure Cosmos DB to provide memory for chat history and state management for your agents to provide durability and context-awareness in your agent interactions.

Learning Objectives and Activities

• Learn the basics for Azure Cosmos DB for storing state and chat history
• Learn how to integrate agent frameworks to Azure Cosmos DB
• Test connectivity to Azure Cosmos DB works
